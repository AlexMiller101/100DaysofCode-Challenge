# Lecture 01: Dynamic Connectivity Problem

> We explore the alogrithms for finding if two elements or items are connected and if not connect them.

### Basic Assumptions

We make some Assumptions just like we do in mathematics and physics to make the solving problem easier

- **Symmetric:** if *p* is connected to *q* then, *q* is also connected to *p*
- **Reflexive:** *p* is also connected *p* itself
- **Transitive:** if *p* is connected to *q* and, *q* is connected to *r* then, *p* is also connected to *r*

### How useful are these alogrithms

- These can be used in mapping networks of data, sorting and finding those data faster.
- Manipulating pixels in a digital photo
- In finding people in a social networks

### Cost Model

We testify the performance of our alogrithms we use this model.

### Quick-Find and Quick-Union Defects

- *Quick-Find* is too slow
- *Quick-Union* becomes too inefficient and slow when the tree gets longer and more data is available
